localization in computer vision = colliculus to predict accuracy + active vision through saccades

Separating visual processing into a What and a Where pathways provides a strategy to model visual search. We developed a deep-learning based computational model in which the comparison of predicted accuracies from both pathways allows for efficient saccade selection.
