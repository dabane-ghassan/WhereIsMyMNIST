The visual search task consists in extracting a scarce and specific visual information (the ``target'') from a large and crowded visual display. In computer vision, this task is usually implemented by scanning the different possible target identities at all possible spatial positions, hence with strong computational load. The human visual system employs a different strategy, combining a foveated sensor with the capacity to rapidly move the center of fixation using saccades. Then, visual processing is separated in two specialized pathways, the ``where'' pathway mainly conveying information about target position in peripheral space (independently of its category), and the ``what'' pathway mainly conveying information about the category of the target (independently of its position). This object recognition pathway is shown here to have an essential role, providing an ``accuracy drive'' that serves to force the eye to foveate peripheral objects in order to increase the peripheral accuracy, much like in the ``actor/critic'' framework. Put together, all those principles to provide ways toward both adaptive and resource-efficient visual processing systems.
