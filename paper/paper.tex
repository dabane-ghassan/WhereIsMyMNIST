\newcommand{\Abstract}{
Visual processing in the brain is done through fast and specialized pathways, one of which mainly conveying information about target position and speed in the peripheral space (the "where" pathway), the other mainly conveying  information about the category of the target (the "what" pathway). The combination of the two pathways is expected to provide most of the useful knowledge about the external visual scene. Still, it is unknown why such a separation exists.
From a computational perspective, it is indeed possible to train a classifier that may recognize both the target's category and position in a single  pass. Current solutions leverage this problem by processing the different hypothesis (categories) at all possible spatial configuration. However, this may be costly in terms of computing time especially without dedicated parallel hardware.
In contrast, the human visual system employs a combination of a foveated sensor with the capacity of rapidly moving the center of fixation using saccades. However, in the foveated image subjects need to locate where the target is without necessarily identifying what it is.  This indeeds provides the capacity to sequentially process visual information, by first identifying the target position in the periphery of the retina, and, after actuating a saccade, identify the target category through detailed retinocentric examination. Indeed, the position and category of objects in images are a priori independent and we hypothesize that the primary retinotopic layers overlay a central area mostly dedicated to object categorization and a peripheral area mostly dedicated to object position in space.
We formalized this problem in a probabilistic setting, allowing to design two interacting image processing pathways: first a classical image classifier, assuming that the gaze is  on the object on the one side, combined with a second processing pathway learning to identify the position of a target (whatever it is) on the other side. Until the classifier is confident, the system should perform a saccade to the most likely target position in the image. Overall, the computational cost of this active inference strategy is less than that in a classical, holistic framework.
We tested this framework on a simple task of finding digits in a large, cluttered image. Results demonstrate that it is possible to correctly learn the position of a putatively interesting visual target, and this before actually identifying its category through foveation (with cluttered noise ensuring the category is actually unreadable in the periphery). We compared the results of this model with classical psychophysical results in visual search. This provides evidence of the importance of identifying "putative interesting targets" first in computer vision and we highlight some predictions of our model.
