Please consider this submission for publication in \Journal . This computational modeling work proposes ``\emph{\Title}'' by defining a trainable neural network framework implementing the essential features of saccade selection in an ecological and theoretically grounded model of visual processing.

Inspired by human vision, we develop an original visual search model based on active inference principles. To alleviate the computational complexity of a fully-predictive visual search, a simple independence assumption (identification vs localization) leads to separating  visual processing in two parallel pathways, such as the what/where visual pathways in humans. This principle is implemented neurally using deep learning, allowing the fast training of an efficient accuracy-seeking policy. We provide a full analysis of the capabilities of such a framework on a synthetic generative model with varying difficulty.

Importantly, our work provides a bio-inspired methodological framework for the processing of complex visual scenes with a sub-linear computational complexity, which we think will provide an essential tool to move forward the field of computer vision.
As such, we believe that this work presents a highly novel and significant finding of broad interest both for computer science and neuroscience
which will have an influential impact on the readership of \Journal .
